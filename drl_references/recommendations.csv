Child Head,"1. As a first step towards radiation dose optimization, please consider reducing the radiation dose
just below the DRL for the specified CT exam type and patient age.
2. Please ensure proper patient centering.
3. Avoid using 140 kV
4. Consider reducing tube current. Please remember that tube current has a linear relation with
radiation dose. A 25% reduction in tube current will lead to 25% decrease in radiation dose if all
other scan factors are constant.
5. When available, please consider using iterative reconstruction (IR) or deep learning (DL)
reconstruction techniques to reduce image noise. Choice of IR strength varies based on the
scanner and vendor (typically a strength of 2-3 (Siemens/Philips), mild-moderate (Canon) or 30-
40% (GE) is sufficient for most CT protocols)."
Child Chest,"1. Please consider reducing the radiation dose just below the DRL for the specified CT exam type
and patient size.
2. Please ensure proper patient centering.
3. For chest CT, please make sure to keep a fast acquisition time (with higher pitch and/or fast
rotation time) to minimize motion artifacts. It is important to avoid or minimize motion artifacts
to avoid loss of diagnostic information and unnecessary repeat scanning.
4. For patients &lt;50 kg, 80 KV is typically sufficient. For patients 50-80 kg, 100 kV is generally
sufficient for chest CT.
5. You can also consider decreasing tube current for reducing radiation dose. Please remember
that tube current has a linear relation with radiation dose. A 25% reduction in tube current will
lead to 25% decrease in radiation dose if all other scan factors are constant.
6. Most chest CT must be performed with a single-phase chest CT protocol. Perform either non-
contrast chest CT or post-contrast CT based on clinical need.
7. When available, please consider using iterative reconstruction (IR) or deep learning (DL)
reconstruction techniques to reduce image noise. Choice of IR strength varies based on the

scanner and vendor (typically a strength of 2-3 (Siemens/Philips), mild-moderate (Canon) or 30-
40% (GE) is sufficient for most CT protocols)."
Child Abdomen,"1. Please consider reducing the radiation dose just below the DRL for the specified CT exam type
and patient size.
2. Please ensure proper patient centering.
3. Avoid use of 140 kV for abdomen CT. You can use 100-120 kV for smaller children (&lt;50 kg). Or
you can use automatic tube potential selection technique.
4. You can consider decreasing tube current for reducing radiation dose. Please remember that
tube current has a linear relation with radiation dose. A 25% reduction in tube current will lead
to 25% decrease in radiation dose if all other scan factors are constant.
5. Most routine pediatric abdomen CT exams should be done with a single-phase CT.
6. When performing multi-phase abdomen CT, ensure proper clinical justification (such as for liver
or renal lesion evaluation or hematuria).
7. For multiphase CT, often the scan length for some phases can be limited to the organ of main
clinical interest. For example, limiting arterial phase CT to liver for liver lesions. Likewise,
eliminating certain phases such as non-contrast phase for liver CT can also help reduce dose.
8. When available, please consider using iterative reconstruction (IR) or deep learning (DL)
reconstruction techniques to reduce image noise. Choice of IR strength varies based on the
scanner and vendor (typically a strength of 2-3 (Siemens/Philips), mild-moderate (Canon) or 30-
40% (GE) is sufficient for most CT protocols)."
Adult Head,"1. Please consider reducing the radiation dose just below the DRL for the specified CT exam type.
2. Please ensure proper patient centering.
3. Avoid using 140 kV
4. Consider reducing tube current. Please remember that tube current has a linear relation with
radiation dose. A 25% reduction in tube current will lead to 25% decrease in radiation dose if all
other scan factors are constant.

and vendor (typically a strength of 2-3 (Siemens/Philips), mild-moderate (Canon) or 30-40% (GE) is
sufficient for most CT protocols)."
Adult Chest,"1. Radiation doses greater than the DRLs are acceptable for large patients.
2. For non-obese patients (typically &lt; 70-80 kg), please consider reducing the radiation dose just below
the DRL for the specified CT exam type.

3. Please ensure proper patient centering.
4. Please keep a fast acquisition time (with higher pitch and/or fast rotation time) to minimize motion
artifacts. It is important to avoid or minimize motion artifacts to avoid loss of diagnostic information
and unnecessary repeat scanning.
5. For patients &lt;50 kg, 80 KV is typically sufficient. For patients 50-80 kg, 100 kV is generally sufficient

6. For some patients, you can reduce tube current for reducing radiation dose. Please remember that
tube current has a linear relation with radiation dose. A 25% reduction in tube current will lead to
25% decrease in radiation dose if all other scan factors are constant.
7. Most chest CT must be performed with a single-phase chest CT protocol. Perform either non-
contrast chest CT or post-contrast CT based on clinical need.
8. For dual-phase chest CT (such as in inspiration and expiration) in patients with interstitial lung
diseases or tracheal collapsibility, please perform expiration phase CT with low radiation dose (at
least 50% below the inspiration phase dose).
9. When available, please consider using iterative reconstruction (IR) or deep learning (DL)
reconstruction techniques to reduce image noise. Choice of IR strength varies based on the scanner
and vendor (typically a strength of 2-3 (Siemens/Philips), mild-moderate (Canon) or 30-40% (GE) is
